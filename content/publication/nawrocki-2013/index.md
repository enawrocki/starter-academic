abstract: Resveratrol, a polyphenolic phytoalexin, is produced by plants in response
  to infection and has antibacterial activity. Haemophilus ducreyi is a Gram-negative
  bacterium that is the causative agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid.
  This study employed minimum cidal concentration (MCC) assays to evaluate the potential
  of resveratrol as a microbicide against H. ducreyi. Five class I and four class
  II strains of H. ducreyi tested had MCCs ≤500 μg/mL. Resveratrol was also tested
  against Lactobacillus spp., part of the natural vaginal flora. Representative strains
  of Lactobacillus were co-cultured with H. ducreyi and 500 μg/mL resveratrol; in
  all cases, Lactobacillus was recovered in greater numbers than H. ducreyi. These
  results show that resveratrol is not only bacteriostatic but is bactericidal to
  H. ducreyi, confirming the compound's potential for use as a topical microbicide
  to prevent chancroid. © 2013 Elsevier B.V. and the International Society of Chemotherapy.
