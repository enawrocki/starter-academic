abstract: Enterohemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EHEC) strains, including the foodborne
  pathogen *E. coli* O157:H7, are responsible for thousands of hospitalizations each
  year. Various environmental triggers can modulate pathogenicity in EHEC by inducing
  the expression of Shiga toxin (Stx), which is encoded on a lambdoid prophage and
  transcribed together with phage late genes. Cell-free supernatants of the sequence
  type 73 (ST73) *E. coli* strain 0.1229 are potent inducers of Stx2a production in
  EHEC, suggesting that 0.1229 secretes a factor that activates the SOS response and
  leads to phage lysis. We previously demonstrated that this factor, designated microcin
  1229 (Mcc1229), was proteinaceous and plasmid-encoded. To further characterize Mcc1229
  and support its classification as a microcin, we investigated its regulation, determined
  its receptor, and identified loci providing immunity. The production of Mcc1229
  was increased upon iron limitation, as determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent
  assay (ELISA), *lacZ* fusions, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Spontaneous
  Mcc1229-resistant mutants and targeted gene deletion revealed that CirA was the
  Mcc1229 receptor. TonB, which interacts with CirA in the periplasm, was also essential
  for Mcc1229 import. Subcloning of the Mcc1229 plasmid indicated that Mcc activity
  was neutralized by two open reading frames (ORFs), each predicted to encode a domain
  of unknown function (DUF)-containing protein. In a germfree mouse model of infection,
  colonization with 0.1229 suppressed subsequent colonization by EHEC. Although Mcc1229
  was produced in vivo, it was dispensable for colonization suppression. The regulation,
  import, and immunity determinants identified here are consistent with features of
  other Mccs, suggesting that Mcc1229 should be included in this class of small molecules.
