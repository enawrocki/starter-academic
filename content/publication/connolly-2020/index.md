abstract: Twenty-seven Salmonella isolates were collected from four locations within
  an ecological wastewater treatment system located at The Pennsylvania State University
  and were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. The sequences obtained were used
  for in silico characterization, including serotyping and phylogenetic relatedness
  analysis.
