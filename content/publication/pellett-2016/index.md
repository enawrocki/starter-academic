abstract: Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), produced by anaerobic bacteria, are the cause
  of the potentially deadly, neuroparalytic disease botulism. BoNTs have been classified
  into seven serotypes, serotypes A to G, based upon their selective neutralization
  by homologous antiserum, which is relevant for clinical and diagnostic purposes.
  Even though supportive care dramatically reduces the death rate of botulism, the
  only pharmaceutical intervention to reduce symptom severity and recovery time is
  early administration of antitoxin (antiserum raised against BoNTs). A recent report
  of a novel BoNT serotype, serotype H, raised concern of a “treatment-resistant”
  and highly potent toxin. However, the toxin's chimeric structure and characteristics
  indicate a chimeric BoNT/FA. Here we describe the first characterization of this
  novel toxin in purified form. BoNT/FA was neutralized by available antitoxins, supporting
  classification as BoNT/FA. BoNT/FA required proteolytic activation to achieve full
  toxicity and had relatively low potency in mice compared to BoNT/A1 but surprisingly
  high activity in cultured neurons. Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), produced by neurotoxigenic
  clostridial species, are the cause of the severe disease botulism in humans and
  animals. Early research on BoNTs has led to their classification into seven serotypes
  (serotypes A to G) based upon the selective neutralization of their toxicity in
  mice by homologous antibodies. Recently, a report of a potential eighth serotype
  of BoNT, designated “type H,” has been controversial. This novel BoNT was produced
  together with BoNT/B2 in a dual-toxin-producing Clostridium botulinum strain. The
  data used to designate this novel toxin as a new serotype were derived from culture
  supernatant containing both BoNT/B2 and novel toxin and from sequence information,
  although data from two independent laboratories indicated neutralization by antibodies
  raised against BoNT/A1, and classification as BoNT/FA was proposed. The sequence
  data indicate a chimeric structure consisting of a BoNT/A1 receptor binding domain,
  a BoNT/F5 light-chain domain, and a novel translocation domain most closely related
  to BoNT/F1. Here, we describe characterization of this toxin purified from the native
  strain in which expression of the second BoNT (BoNT/B) has been eliminated. Mass
  spectrometry analysis indicated that the toxin preparation contained only BoNT/FA
  and confirmed catalytic activity analogous to that of BoNT/F5. The in vivo mouse
  bioassay indicated a specific activity of this toxin of 3.8 × 10 7 mouse 50% lethal
  dose (mLD 50 ) units/mg, whereas activity in cultured human neurons was very high
  (50% effective concentration [EC 50 ] = 0.02 mLD 50 /well). Neutralization assays
  in cells and mice both indicated full neutralization by various antibodies raised
  against BoNT/A1, although at 16- to 20-fold-lower efficiency than for BoNT/A1. IMPORTANCE
