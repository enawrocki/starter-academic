abstract: The development of next generation sequencing methods reduced the costs
  and improved the accuracy of sequencing. These advances accelerated its application
  in microbial genotyping and made it feasible to implement in foodborne pathogen
  subtyping and surveillance. Sequencing of all or nearly all nucleotides in a microbial
  genome provides superior discriminatory power that surpasses performance of other
  genotyping methods, such as pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or multi-locus
  sequence typing (MLST), that have been used in pathogen subtyping prior to whole
  genome sequencing (WGS). This allows for a detailed comparison of similarity among
  strains of foodborne pathogens. WGS data provide a resource that can be used for
  assessment of strains' relatedness based on inferred phylogenetic relationships,
  evolution, and functional capacity, and has therefore become an invaluable tool
  in foodborne pathogen surveillance, characterization, and source tracking. In this
  chapter, we review sequencing technologies used for whole genome sequencing, implementation
  of WGS in foodborne pathogen surveillance by regulatory and public health agencies,
  WGS data analyses approaches, in silico prediction of relevant phenotypes, as well
  as challenges and opportunities related to international standardization of data
  analyses and communication.
